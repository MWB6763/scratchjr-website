                If we rely on consent for the processing of your personal information, you have the
                right to withdraw it at any time and free of charge. When you do so, this will not
                affect the lawfulness of the processing before your consent withdrawal. Please note
                that we may have valid legal reasons to refuse your request and will inform you if
                that is the case. For more information on your rights, or to submit a request to
                exercise your rights under applicable law, please contact us as indicated in the

            <h2>Data Retention</h2>
            <p className="summary">
                We don't keep your information forever. We only keep it for as long as we need it to
                help us do the activities explained in this policy.
            </p>
            <p>
                We take measures to delete your personal information or keep it in a form that does
                not allow you to be identified when this information is no longer necessary for the
                purposes for which we process it, unless we are required by law to keep this
                information for a longer period. When determining the retention period, we take into
                account various criteria, such as the type of services requested by or provided to
                you, the nature and length of our relationship with you, possible re-enrollment with
                our services, the impact on the services we provide to you if we delete some
                information from or about you, mandatory retention periods provided by law and the
                statute of limitations.

            <p className="summary">We take steps to keep your information safe and secure.</p>
            <p>
                We have in place administrative, physical, and technical procedures that are
                intended to protect the information we collect on the App against accidental or
                unlawful destruction, accidental loss, unauthorized alteration, unauthorized
                disclosure or access, misuse, and any other unlawful form of processing of the
                Personal Information in our possession. However, as effective as these measures are,
                no security system is impenetrable. We cannot completely guarantee the security of
                our databases, nor can we guarantee that the information you supply will not be
                intercepted while being transmitted to us over the internet.
