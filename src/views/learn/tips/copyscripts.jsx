            You can copy a script from one character to another by dragging the
            script from the programming area to the character in the list on the left.
            <img
                alt="Copy A Script"
                className="content-section-image"
                src="/images/tips/copy-script.png"

            But you can also duplicate a script in a single programming area if you
            drag the script to the same character the script belongs to in the character list.
            <img
                alt="Duplicate A Script"
                className="content-section-image"

            /><br />
            The copy will appear on top of the original script, but slightly offset.
            Just drag it over to one side to see both copies.<br />
            The only thing that can&apos;t be copied from one character to another is a
            recorded sound. If a script has a recorded sound, the sound will be replaced
            by the Pop sound in the copied script. You can copy sounds for the same
            character though, so the recorded sound will duplicate itself in the duplicated script
