            Then select your sharing method: <em>Share by Email</em> or <em>Share
            by AirDrop</em>. Regardless of which method you use
            to send your project, the recipient tablet must have ScratchJr
            installed. If you choose to share by AirDrop, the sender and
            the recipient must both be iPads.

            When they tap Open in &apos;ScratchJr&apos;, they will see the project

            will disappear from the Home screen.

            To use AirDrop, you need to know the name of the iPad you
            want to send your project to. You can find out the name
            of an iPad by going to <em>Settings &gt; General &gt; About &gt; Name</em>. Make sure
            Bluetooth and Wifi are also turned on for both iPads,
            and make sure you are within about 30 feet of the iPad
            you want to send to. When you select AirDrop, you will
            see which iPads are ready to receive your project.

            These are the iPads that are available for AirDrop. If you
            don&apos;t see the iPad you&apos;re looking for, make sure it&apos;s on
            and not sleeping.

        <div className="content-section-item-description">
            When you select an iPad for AirDrop, the recipient will see the following message:

            If AirDrop isn&apos;t available on your iPad (earlier than 4th

            <em>Note: If you have several iPads with the same name,

        <div className="content-section-item-description">
            When you share a project all the images, recordings, sounds,
            and any created characters or backgrounds in your project
            will be transferred from one device to the other.<br /><br />
            ScratchJr doesn&apos;t number or rename the project on the target
            device, so if you send it lots of times you can end up with
            multiple copies of the same project. ScratchJr treats each
            copy as a separate project even if each copy has the same
            name, so if you make any changes to a project make sure to
            rename it before you share it so that the recipient can
            distinguish between the versions.
